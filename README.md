# Futurama Memory Game

## Description:
This application is a click-based memory game with a Futurama theme. After clicking on an image, the images will reshuffle. Your goal is to try to get the max score (which goes up to 12).

## Rules:
1. Click on an image and remember it.
2. Click on any other image that you haven't clicked yet.
3. Repeat clicking images that you have not clicked until your score is at max.

If you reach the max score, your score will reset on the next click. Or if you fail and re-click an image, your score will also reset.
